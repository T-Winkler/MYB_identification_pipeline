All code needed to run the MYB identification pipeline can be found in the Identification_pipeline markdown file. 

Required Software:
- R with Rmarkdown
- HMMER command line application
- CLUSTALW command line application
(see markdown file)

Required files:
- HMM scan input file (fasta), generated from the full outer join of putative MYB proteins of a species detected by HMM scan or BLAST
- Gff3 file of the used genome annotation
- Fasta file of the used genome assembly

All required files can be stored at Data/parameter_files. The path to the files in addition to the name of the species has to be set in the markdown document as parameters (see markdown file for more information).

The only folders in which input files are saved in the Data/ directory. 
In the Output/ folders different output files are saved. See the markdown document or the README files in the folders for more information.
Under Plots/ different generated plots are saved. See the markdown document or the README files in the folders for more information.
